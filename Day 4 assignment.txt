Subquery Examples:

1) SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 4500) ;

2) INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS_BKP SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM CUSTOMERS) ;

3) UPDATE CUSTOMERS SET SALARY = SALARY * 0.25 WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP WHERE AGE >= 27 );

4) DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP WHERE AGE >= 27 );

5) SELECT a.studentid, a.name, b.total_marks FROM student a, marks b WHERE a.studentid = b.studentid AND b.total_marks > (SELECT total_marks FROM marks WHERE studentid =  '1002');

Joins Examples:

Inner join :- 
SELECT b.id, b.title, a.first_name, a.last_name FROM books b INNER JOIN authors a ON b.author_id = a.id ORDER BY b.id

SELECT b.id, b.title, b.type, t.last_name AS translator FROM books b JOIN translators t ON b.translator_id = t.id ORDER BY b.id;

Left join :-
SELECT b.id, b.title, b.type, a.last_name AS author, t.last_name AS translator FROM books b LEFT JOIN authors a ON b.author_id = a.id LEFT JOIN translators t ON b.translator_id = t.id ORDER BY b.id;

SELECT b.id, b.title, e.last_name AS editor FROM books b LEFT JOIN editors e ON b.editor_id = e.id ORDER BY b.id;

Right join :-
SELECT b.id, b.title, e.last_name AS editor FROM books b RIGHT JOIN editors e ON b.editor_id = e.id ORDER BY b.id;

Full join :- 
SELECT b.id, b.title, e.last_name AS editor FROM books b FULL JOIN editors e ON b.editor_id = e.id ORDER BY b.id;

SELECT b.id, b.title, a.last_name AS author, e.last_name AS editor, t.last_name AS translator FROM books b FULL JOIN authors a ON b.author_id = a.id FULL JOIN editors e ON b.editor_id = e.id FULL JOIN translators t ON b.translator_id = t.id ORDER BY b.id;
